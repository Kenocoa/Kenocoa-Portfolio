TERMS OF SERVICE

By commissioning me you understand and agree to my Terms of Service. Please read carefully before placing your commission as failing to acknowledge or abide by these guidelines will lead to a void transaction and cancellation of your commission! You may also risk a permanent blacklist ban from future commission opportunities. 

    Introduction

        I the artist reserve the right to turn down any work for any reason.

        I may cancel the commission and issue a full refund if I decide to no longer work with a client.

        There are no deadlines unless specified otherwise, only rough estimates. 

        My queue is public and can be found here on trello.

        Clients may request anonymity and/or an alias on the queue (i.e. gifts)

     Commission Process 

        Communication will be done through Telegram [@kenocoa], Twitter [@kenocoaa] Discord [kenocoa], or email [kenocoaart@gmail.com]. You may initially contact me through Deviantart or Furaffinity notes however I might not respond as quickly!

        A reference of your character is required. A description and/or references for pose or scene elements you would like is recommended. FYI I commonly ask for the expression and emotions of the character cause it helps me with the story telling :3

	I can go by description (usually covered by a +$50 custom design fee), refs or multiple images as long as you’re clear and precise.

	Once details of the artwork's layout have been discussed and I am confident I know what you're looking for, we will agree on the full price of the artwork. Payment will then be made in full or in accordance with an agreed payment plan.

        Please note that if I don't receive a response or payment in a timely manner I will consider the slot abandoned and remove you from the queue.

        Unless specified otherwise you will be sent a sketch for approval, giving you a chance to change things. You get two passes before getting charged for additional changes. (the exception is fixing mistakes on the artists side)

        You may ask for updates or WIPS at any time, but please be respectful about it.   ♥⊂ʕ•ᴥ•⊂ʔ 

        After you accept the sketch the commission is finished and there will be no room for major changes without additional charges, the only exception is if I the artist has misinterpreted the design or missed anything that was clearly stated in the commission form.

        If you want to make changes or add detail to a finished commission, you can pay an additional $30 USD per hour to reach a desired result. (i.e. experimental pay what you want commissions you want to take a bit further, adding a background and changing shading to fit a piece that didn’t initially come with a background, having an alternate clothing edit made etc.) This also applies if you have an older commission that you want me to fix up for you.

        When the commission is finished I'll share a Google Drive folder containing the following: A low res JPEG that can be posted publicly,  a full res JPEG and PNG to be used privately, and any edits or extra versions. It’s your own responsibility to download and archive these for your own use.

    Payment

	Prices are listed in USD, and are a general estimate. They may change based on character or concept complexity, however this is more for exceptionally intricate designs.

	Full price of commission is decided upfront. If your desired work doesn't easily fit into my commission categories I can help negotiate a unique price for you using an hourly based price estimate ^^

	Commissions below $150 are paid in advance. For prices $150 and greater payment plans can be negotiated if necessary.

	> I support two payment methods: Stripe (preferred) or Paypal
		- FOR STRIPE: I will send you a link to my Stripe payment portal, and you can then fill in our agreed price in AUD (as converted from USD), your email address, and payment details [using any of the major card providers that stripe supports].
		- PAYPAL: I will send a Paypal invoice to your provided email.

    Refunds and payment plans

	The client is responsible for their own financial situation. I do not issue refunds for the client's failure to manage personal finances or obligations. 

        In the event that you are dissatisfied with my service or product, please let me know! I pride myself in my reputation and am open to work with you to address any problems or concerns. For any formal disputes please contact me beforehand, as otherwise I will need to take legal action and you will likely be blacklisted.

        For commissions below $150, I will not issue refunds after I start work on a commission. It is however okay to back out of a commission before I've started drawing, just let me know quickly!

    4.a Payment plans

        Payment plans can be issued on a case to case basis on orders $150+

        Payment plans require additional contractual agreements suiting the nature of the artwork in question.

        $150-500 payment plans can be paid in 50/50 or 30/30/30 installments over a month.

        Payment plans may be subject to penalties for late payments.

4.b Commission Termination after work has begun (only relevant to payment plans)

         If your commission is terminated and refunded all rights to the supplied artwork returns to me as the artist to use as I please.

	If you terminate your commission you are subject to fees, such as an inconvenience fee and consultation fee. This will be deducted from your refund.

        If work has begun, the client is subject to a partial (50%) refund up to the lining and coloring stage.

        Past this stage refunds are no longer eligible, but can be negotiated on an individual basis for exceptions. 

        When the artwork is paid off and completed refunds are no longer negotiable.  

        You can purchase the rights to cancelled work to avoid it being recycled, just contact me for details.

    Copyright and licensing 

        I maintain right to all work I create in any digital, traditional or print form under the name Kenocoa. This includes but is not limited to using commissioned work in portfolios, prints, merchandise, etc. 

        If you wish to purchase the rights to your commission or character for commercial purposes (for profit) you need to pay a fee in addition of the original price, and depending on licensing intent you may be subject to royalty fees. 

        If you do not want your piece to be included in any resale or promotional material you can request to be excepted from this when placing your commission.

        You have the right to use your commissioned piece for any personal/private use. i.e. sharing your commission on social media, uploading it to Toyhouse, and everything from icons, banners, uploads, prints or phone screens for yourself and loved ones. If you are unsure if something qualifies for private and personal use; contact me. 

        I reserve the right to make changes to any work I create for my own personal and commercial use. This may include but is not limited to re-purposing a background for my business or personal use, or putting some clothes on a undressed character for print. 

	For commissions produced after 3rd November 2023 I may sell your finished commission as paper art prints at convention spaces, you can opt out of this though just let me know! For work commissioned before this date I will individually contact you if I am looking to sell prints of art you purchased.

        The client may upload and share their commission anywhere as long credit is given to the artist.

        The client may modify or color their commission, as long as it’s respectful to the original piece and credit is given. 

    “Your Character Here” (YCH)

    5. General

        YCHs will be announced through social media, and availability will be subject to the individual posts guidelines. 

        Payment is expected in full 24 hours after claiming or winning a bid, if client fails to provide information / payment in a timely manner the slot will be revoked and re-listed. 

        Failure to pay or cancel in a timely manner can result in a future blacklisting. 

        In the case of auctions where the winner fails to claim their piece in one way or another, the second highest bidder may be contacted for an opportunity to claim if it isn’t re-listed right away.

        You will receive a WIP sketch once I have adjusted the YCH to suit your character.

        Individual guidelines per listing usually applies, but unless specified otherwise there is usually no gender, species or wing restrictions. 

        For best results I do however recommend a YCH that looks like it would already fit your character.

        I reserve the right to turn down a YCH claim for a slot if I do not feel the character(s) would be a good fit.
