= GENERAL
- Communication will be done through Telegram [@kenocoa] (preferred), Twitter [@kenocoaa] or Discord [Kenocoa#2654]. You may initially contact me through Deviantart or Furaffinity notes however I might not respond as quickly.
- A reference of your character is required. A description of the pose you would like is recommended. FYI I commonly ask for the expression and emotions of the character cause it helps me with the story telling!
- I maintain copyright of the picture i draw. If you want to edit, resell or commercially use my art you require my permission.
- I may use your final commission and its work in progress stages for commercial purposes (posting on social media, timelapses, art collages etc.) -> For commissions produced after 3rd November 2023 I may sell your finished commission as art prints at convention spaces, you can opt out of this though just let me know! For work commissioned before this date I will individually contact you if I am looking to sell prints of art you purchased.
- When the commission is finished I'll share a Google Drive link to a folder containing: A low res JPEG to be posted publicly, a full res JPEG and PNG to be used privately, any edits or extra versions
- You can repost the finished image, just please provide credit!
- Once started, production of the commission should take less than 3 weeks. If I expect longer than this I will let you know (this mostly applies to fullbody+background commissions).

- Extra character: +10% the price of whichever tier the artwork would be without them ie. Fullbody + extra character = 150+15 = 165

= PAYMENT
- Full price of commission is decided upfront in USD. If your desired work doesn't easily fit into my commission categories I can help negotiate a respective price for you using an hourly based price estimate ^^

> I support two payment methods: Stripe (preferred) or Paypal
- FOR STRIPE: I will send you a link to my Stripe payment portal, and you can then fill in our agreed price in AUD (as converted from USD at the most recent exchange rate), your email address and payment details [using any of the major card providers that stripe supports].
- PAYPAL: I will send a Paypal invoice to your provided email.

- I will not issue refunds after I start work on a commission. It is however okay to back out of a commission before I've started drawing, just let me know quickly!

WILL DRAW: sfw, teasing, any body type or species, couples art, characters from popular shows/media

WONT DRAW: nsfw, kinks/fetishes, feral, political or hate art

BTW: All tiers are fully rendered to the best of my ability, they are generally priced to represent my hours worked.
If you are on a more modest budget I do occasionally offer YCH's at lower price points! 

Hourly Based Costing [new]
Added this because I feel like my existing price/commissioning structure is somewhat limited. This way you can tell me any idea you have, and I'll do my best to fit that within your budget.

This is primarily to make getting partial and full body artworks a lot more affordable as they don't take quite as long for me as they used to!

This also simplifies the need for a "sketch" quality tier.

I've added some time guides to the existing price hierarchy to help clarify this though again, I can work comfortably outside of that!

Working rate is USD$20 per hour. From this the total price will be negotiated and then paid upfront through stripe.

6 - 7 hours worked

SCENE: Full body
$150-$225 (higher prices will allow me to justify greater level of detail and hours worked)
Character can vary in scale relative to scene.
ie. Focus is on landscape, character is within it, or maybe the focus is on a character, and the scene compliments this.

Examples:

https://www.furaffinity.net/view/47954287/

Typically spent 8-15 hours, though it ultimately comes down to the complexity of the scene and the level of detail I need to do it justice!
