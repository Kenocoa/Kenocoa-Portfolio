              <p>

                    <br> <br>For poses I recommend including props, clothing, hand signs or strong perspective!
                    <br> <br>Scenes are highly flexible and can include vehicles, interiors, exteriors or landscapes along with the character. 
                    <br> <br>Refined sketches can be made fully rendered at a later date at a reduced cost ie. an $80 fully rendered bust may be commissioned by paying an extra $50 on a $30 refined bust sketch.

              <p>
                Detailed characters and scenes make the painting process more interesting for me! Please dont hesitate to ask for goofy little character or scene details.
                <br> <br>Like refined sketches I recommend including props, clothing, hand signs or strong perspective for poses, and for scenes to consider unique vehicles, interiors, exteriors or landscapes along with the character. 
                <br> <br>I can also recommend giving me a specific choice of lighting to work with ie day vs. night, artificial vs. natural, or challenging, unique environments.
                <br> <br>Poses come with a relatively simple pattern background like the one on the right -> (custom rendered using GMIC).

                                <li>Communication will be done through Telegram [@kenocoa], Twitter [@kenocoaa] Discord [kenocoa], or email [kenocoaart@gmail.com].</li>
                                <li>A reference of your character is required. A description and/or references for pose or scene elements you would like is recommended. FYI I commonly ask for the expression and emotions of the character cause it helps me with the story telling :3</li>
                                <li>Once details of the artwork's layout have been discussed and I am confident I know what you're looking for, we will agree on the full price of the artwork. Payment will then be made in full or in accordance with an agreed payment plan.</li>

                                      <li>Please note that if I don't receive a response or payment in a timely manner I will consider the slot abandoned and remove you from the queue.</li>

                                <li>You will then be sent a sketch for approval, giving you a chance to change things. You get two passes before getting charged for additional changes. (fixing of mistakes I've made aren't counted as changes)</li>
                                <li>After you accept the sketch I will finish the commission and there will be no room for major changes without additional charges. The only exception is if I have misinterpreted the design or missed anything that was clearly stated in the commission form!</li>
                                    <ul class="paddingTOS">
                                      <li>If you want to make changes or add detail to a finished commission, you can pay an additional $30 USD per hour to reach a desired result. This also applies if you have an older commission that you want me to fix up for you.</li>

                                <li>In the event that you are dissatisfied with my service or product, please let me know! I pride myself in my reputation and am open to work with you to address any problems or concerns. </li>
                                <li>For any formal disputes please contact me beforehand, as otherwise I will need to take legal action and you will likely be blacklisted.</li>
                                <li>The client is responsible for their own financial situation. I do not issue refunds for the client's failure to manage personal finances or obligations.</li>
